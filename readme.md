# Roland Boilerplate

The Roland module is a simple reference boilerplate for creating html tables in ExpressionEngine that require repeating and sortable rows (for settings forms etc).

I've just combined the stock [jQuery UI Sortable](http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/) method along with [jquery.roland.js](https://github.com/experience/jquery.roland.js) which is a jQuery plugin written by @monooso
